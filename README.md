Deep learning for complex pattern recognition
Advanced feature extraction
Risk Assessment Algorithm
The system evaluates multiple factors:

Transaction amount and patterns
Time-based analysis (unusual hours)
Geographic risk assessment
Account age and transaction velocity
Behavioral pattern matching
Cross-referencing with known fraud indicators

 Risk Scoring Matrix
Risk Level	Score Range	Action Required
Low Risk	0-39	Standard monitoring
Medium Risk	40-69	Additional verification
High Risk	70-100	Block transaction, investigate

 Testing & Validation
Test Scenarios
High-risk transactions: Large amounts during odd hours
Account-based risks: New accounts with high-value transactions
Geographic patterns: Transactions in high-risk locations
Behavioral anomalies: Unusual transaction patterns
Sample Test Data
javascript
// High Risk Example
{
  amount: 150000,
  hour: 2,
  type: "transfer",
  location: "Hyderabad",
  accountAge: 15,
  prevTransactions: 3
}

// Low Risk Example
{
  amount: 5000,
  hour: 14,
  type: "debit",
  location: "Mumbai",
  accountAge: 365,
  prevTransactions: 45
}
